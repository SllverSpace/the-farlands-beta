worlds can be put onto the server

their sets will be limited to a number

players will have to delete old sets and admins can get rid of protectectors if they are becoming issues

if a new lobby is created and the server is full, then they will have to wait 3-24 hours for a request to the least active server
owner to download their world, then it will be closed and the slot will be reserved for the next 24 hours for the player to create
their world on the server or upload one.

the least popular world will be calculated by player per hour median. So if you're world is not doing well, you'll have to download
it and then improve it to keep it on the server.

of course i will be able to reserve a slot for me or friends to host a lobby on the server bc we want to always be able to play.
